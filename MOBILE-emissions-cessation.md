- Vote Requirements: veMOBILE Holders

## Summary

This proposal aims to halt MOBILE token emissions and secure the allocation of 2.9M HNT to the MOBILE treasury, as well as the 1.3M HNT Growth Fund following the burning of 18.2B MOBILE tokens from the Operations Fund, as outlined in HIP 138. This HIP addresses the specific needs of the MOBILE network following the partial implementation of HIP 138.

## Motivation

- To align the MOBILE network with the broader Helium ecosystem's move towards simplification and unified tokenomics.
- To secure the additional HNT allocation for the MOBILE treasury.
- To reduce the circulating supply of MOBILE tokens.
- To streamline rewards distribution directly in HNT, making the system more attractive to network builders and participants.

## Stakeholders

- MOBILE network participants (Hotspot owners, operators)
- MOBILE token holders
- Helium Foundation
- Future MOBILE network builders and investors

Feedback will be solicited through:
- Helium Community Discord channels
- Helium Forum discussions
- Direct outreach to major MOBILE network stakeholders

## Detailed Explanation

This HIP proposes the following key actions:

1. **Cessation of MOBILE Token Emissions**: All new emissions of MOBILE tokens will be halted upon implementation of this HIP.

2. **HNT Allocation to MOBILE Treasury**: As outlined in HIP 138, 2.9M HNT will be minted and allocated to the MOBILE treasury. This will occur gradually from the implementation date until the next halvening (August 1, 2025).

3. **Burning of Operations Fund MOBILE Tokens**: The Helium Foundation will burn 18.2B MOBILE tokens currently held in the Operations Fund and receive their 1.3M HNT Growth Fund.

4. **Direct HNT Rewards**: MOBILE network participants will receive rewards directly in HNT, based on the existing Utility Score mechanism.

## Implementation Timeline:
On or before January 15, 2025.

## Drawbacks

Potential confusion for MOBILE network participants during the transition period.

## Rationale and Alternatives

This proposal is the best path forward because:
- It aligns with the broader Helium ecosystem's direction as set by HIP 138.
- It secures additional value for the MOBILE network through HNT allocation.
- It simplifies the reward structure, making it more attractive for network growth.
