## Summary

This proposal aims to halt MOBILE token emissions and replace them with HNT emissions in accordance with HIP 138. It seeks to secure the allocation of 2.9M HNT to the MOBILE treasury and establish a new 1.3M HNT MOBILE Growth Fund in exchange for burning 18.2B MOBILE tokens from the Operations Fund. This HIP addresses the specific needs of the MOBILE network following the partial approval of HIP 138.

HIP 138 clearly states the contingency for the MOBILE network in its Detailed Explanation section:

> Revoke the remaining 18.2B MOBILE currently in the MOBILE Operations Fund, and request that Helium Foundation burn these tokens, contingent on the veMOBILE decision to discontinue MOBILE emissions.

and

> Emit the remaining 2.9M HNT directly into the MOBILE treasury on an epochal basis until the next halvening (2025-08-01), contingent on the veMOBILE decision to discontinue MOBILE emissions.

## Motivation

- To align the MOBILE network with the broader Helium ecosystem's move towards simplification and unified tokenomics.
- To secure the additional HNT allocation for the MOBILE treasury.
- To reduce the circulating supply of MOBILE tokens.
- To streamline rewards distribution directly in HNT, making the system more attractive to network builders and participants.

## Stakeholders

- MOBILE network participants (Hotspot owners, operators)
- MOBILE token holders
- Helium Foundation
- Future MOBILE network builders and investors

Feedback will be solicited through:
- Helium Community Discord channels
- Helium Forum discussions
- Direct outreach to major MOBILE network stakeholders

## Detailed Explanation

The passing of this HIP will result in the following key actions:

1. **Cessation of MOBILE Token Emissions**: All new emissions of MOBILE tokens will be halted before or simultaneously with the implementation of HIP 138.

2. **HNT Allocation to MOBILE Treasury**: As outlined in HIP 138, 2.9M HNT will be minted and allocated to the MOBILE treasury. This will occur gradually from the implementation date until the next halvening (August 1, 2025).

3. **Exchange of Operations Fund MOBILE Tokens**: The Helium Foundation will burn the 18.2B MOBILE tokens currently held in the Operations Fund for a new 1.3M HNT MOBILE Growth Fund. This exchange is necessary because, as a non-profit, the Foundation cannot destroy its assets without compensation. The Growth Fund will be used to support future development of the MOBILE network.

## Implementation Timeline:
This HIP must be implemented before or simultaneously with the implementation of HIP 138 to ensure a smooth transition and to secure the proposed benefits in HIP 138 for the MOBILE network.

## Drawbacks

Potential confusion for MOBILE network participants during the transition period.

## Rationale and Alternatives

This proposal is the best path forward because:
- It aligns with the broader Helium ecosystem's direction as set by HIP 138.
- It secures additional value for the MOBILE network through HNT allocation.
- It simplifies the reward structure, making it more attractive for network growth.

## Deployment Impact

This proposal will be implemented by Helium core developers. An initial investigation of the work required suggests that this HIP can be implemented within the specified timeline.

## Success Metrics

This HIP is successful if MOBILE emissions cease by the implementation of HIP 138.
